## Overview and Origin

Paypal is the world's most widely used payment acquirer, processing over $936billion in payment in 2020. More than 28 milliom merchants and 325 million active account holders use Paypal.  Paypal was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek in December 1998 as Cofinity, a company that developed security software for handheld devices. It had no success with that business model, however it focus to a digital wallet. Cofinity launch the first version of the PayPal electronic payment in 1999. In March 2000, Confinity merged with x.com, an online financial service company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk. In October 2000, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on PayPal, x.com was renamed PayPal in 2001 and went public in 2002. PayPal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.

## Business Activities:

The payments industry has three key factions that make the whole system run as well as it does.Those factions are the payment card networks (dominated by Visa and Mastercard, with American Express a distant third), the banks and the merchants/retailers. The card networks oversee the payment rails (i.e. how payments are processed) that banks leverage when they issue credit cards and debit cards to consumers and businesses. Merchants and retailers use the card networks’ payment rails to transact commerce with consumers. When a consumer buys something from a merchant or retailer, the merchant’s bank requests payment from the consumer’s bank. In order to handle this request, the consumer’s banks charges the merchant bank an interchange fee (at 1.5% + plus 10 cents per transaction). Because the entire transaction takes place on top of the Visa or Mastercard’s payment rails, an assessment fee (at 2.5–3%) is charged to the merchant bank. This process happens every time you swipe or dip your card in-store or input your credit card or debit card information online. 
Understanding the terms and interactions above is necessary in understanding how the payments ecosystem works and, more importantly, how to innovate in that ecosystem and gain a competitive advantage. There are really only two paths to innovating in payments:
Building on top of credit cards (and the card networks), or
Create a new payment system and the accompanying network to support it.
The first path has been done before (see all retailer mobile wallets or points-based credit cards), is relatively easy to do, but creates no material value created other than having an app icon on a consumer’s smartphone home screen, if you’re lucky. If you’re a major retailer or bank focused on building consumer loyalty, there are worse ways to build that loyalty. However, this path isn’t a differentiator and it certainly won’t give you a competitive advantage that couldn’t be overcome by a determined competitor with a sizeable marketing budget.

The second path, creating a new payment system and network, is incredibly hard to build, but could be infinitely valuable if consumer and retailer/merchant adoption reached critical mass. This is what the original PayPal team tried to create before selling to eBay in 2002. That opportunity never went away and after PayPal spun out from eBay in 2015, the new PayPal has been putting the pieces in place to seize it again. There are many reasons why the original PayPal plan didn’t succeed, but the most important were that it was burning cash on customer acquisition and the internet was just starting to rise prominence in consumer life. The rise of the consumer internet and, subsequently, mobile has brought down distribution costs and brought billions of people online. Sometimes being early is the same as being wrong, but if you’ve survive along, you just might be proven right.


One of the biggest advantages of PayPal is its low barrier to entry. Anyone can create an account and start using it in under 10 minutes. Compared to opening an account at a traditional bank or a financial institution that requires a visit to a physical branch and tons of paperwork, PayPal is much more convenient. All you need to do is sign up and input your information online – no lengthy queues and unnecessary bureaucracy. 

Connecting an existing bank account or a credit card is very easy. As a result, all types of businesses and everyday consumers have quick access to a broad payment ecosystem. From splitting a bill at dinner to selling products online, PayPal gives people the ability to send and accept money with just a few taps. 

Once you set up a PayPal account with your bank account or credit card, you can keep using it wherever you shop. Instead of entering credit card information time after time, all you need to do is log in with PayPal to make a purchase. Not only does this save you time, but it also keeps your bank information safe during transactions. 

Retailers, e-commerce stores, and even restaurants who use the platform can attract customers with faster checkout, giving them an advantage over their competition. But that’s not the only benefit for business owners. PayPal’s merchant services are a fantastic way to keep things organized.

22 million active merchant accounts

$17.8 billion in total revenue in 2019

12.4 billion payment transactions in 2019

According to McKinsey, the global payment market revenue in 2019 was $1.9 trillion and is expected to grow by 6% per annum to $2.7 trillion in 2023. Customers are increasingly turning to nonbank financial providers like PayPal for functionality traditional banking services do not provide. 


eBay acquired PayPal in 2002, needing a solution to the checks and money orders being used to exchange money on its platform — and it was at this point that PayPal transitioned from exclusively peer-to-peer (P2P) to buyer-to-merchant payments. Today, PayPal offers the option to do both — users can send money to their friends, just as they did in the early days of PayPal, as well as pay for goods from eBay and many other online merchants.

At its most basic, PayPal uses a digital (and sometimes physical) layer to allow more seamless Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers between bank accounts, greatly decreasing the friction of online and P2P payments. PayPal’s technology enables an online merchant to collect payments from users whether or not they have a PayPal account.

## Landscape:


PayPal is one of the most well-known companies in the payments industry
PayPal is No. 7 rating of the Best Credit Card Processors of 2021. PayPal is one of the best-known payment processors for small businesses and its fixed-rate pricing structure is easy to understand. It offers plans with no monthly fees, and its transaction rate for online purchases – 2.9% plus 30 cents – is on par with competitors like Square and Stripe.

According to Morning Consult, PayPal is the second-most trusted brand in the world. In fact, PayPal is a popular choice for online retailers because a lot of shoppers have experience using PayPal. And buyers are almost three times more likely to complete a transaction on a website where the PayPal logo is visible, according to a recent Nielsen study. PayPal is also a practical choice for international firms since it’s available in more than 200 countries and accepts more than two dozen currencies.

## Recommendations

The only thing I don't like in Paypal is the fact that they move you away from marchant website at checkout.
I think they need to find a way to integrate PayPal checkout in any marchant website, without moving the customer.
Their developper team would need to find a script, to fix this issue
